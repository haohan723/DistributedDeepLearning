# Distributed-Deep-Learning
## SECTION TWO – Scaling Deep Learning using Keras and Tensorflow- (30 mins)
### Topic/Concept 1 – Tensorflow Introduction
In this video we will talk about: 
1. What is tensorFlow
2. Why TensorFlow
3. Key concepts to build a graph in TensorFlow
4. Tensorflow Installation 

### Topic/Concept 2 – Tensorboard Introduction
In this video we will be learning how to leverage tensorboard for informative visualizations: 
1. What is tensorboard 
2. Why should we use tensorboard
3. How to set up tensorboard 
4. Example (covers scalar, histogram, embedding, graph, image, distribution)

### Topic/Concept 3 – Types of Parallelism in Deep Learning – Synchronous vs Asynchronous
In this video we are going to discuss the following topics:
1. What is data parallelism
2. Data Parallelism vs Model Parallelism 
3. What is the goal of parallelization 
4. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Parallelism

### Topic/Concept 4 – Distributed Deep Learning with tensorflow 
In order to create train your TensorFlow in a distributed fashion you will need to do the following steps:
1. Create Clusters and servers
2. Manged Sessions 
3. Replicating a computational graph across devices
4. Device Placement

### Topic/Concept 5 – Configuring Keras to use tensorflow for Distributed problems 
In this video we will learn how to configure keras use Tensorflow to train you model in a distributed fashion. In order to achieve the purpose we will need to learn the following topics: 
1. Calling Keras layes on Tensorflow tensors
2. using Keras models with TensorFlow 
3. Distributed Training 
4. Exporting a model with Tensorflow Serving 
5. Distributed Training Example
